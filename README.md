Helpers for Simulant's process state service

## Background

Agents have access to a temporary in-memory Datomic database during a sim
run (via the process-state service). Certain information (like current auth
credentials) needs to be remembered during a sim run, but is irrelevant to
validation.

## Usage:

1. Add `[io.homegrown/sim-ephemeral "1.0.0"]` to your Simulant project's
   `:dependencies`
2. During sim setup invoke `simulant.sim/create-process-state` after
   `simulant.sim/create-sim`.
3. Inside an agent action, invoke `io.homegrown.sim-ephemeral`'s `retrieve`,
   `store`, or `clear` as necessary. These functions will automatically gain
   access to a process-local, in-memory Datomic database. See individual
   function docs for more information on usage.

For example:

```clj
(ns my.ns
  (:require [io.homegrown.sim-ephemeral :refer [store]]
            [simulant.util :as util :refer [e solo]]))

(declare do-something)
(declare extract-value)

(defmethod sim/perform-action :action.type/myAction [action process]
  (try
    (let [agent        (-> action :agent/_actions solo)
          [resp nsecs] (timed (do-something))]
      (store agent :some-info :db.cardinality/one :db.type/string (extract-value resp))
      (log action process resp nsecs))
    (catch Throwable t
      (log-error action process t 0))))
```

## Caveats

Because process-state stores are local to a Simulant process, agents running
on separate processes *will not* be able to access each other's keys/values."
